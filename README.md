## About
The purpose of this project is to show how easily misinformation can be spread. Without even realizing it, one could be perpetuating a false narrative.

### Misinformation
Misinformation is false or inaccurate information that is usually intended to deceive, although it may be unintentional as well. This can be found in many places, from video games, to relationships, to even the news and media.

### Misinformation vs Disinformation:
Disinformation is more propaganda than anything else. It is typically used by government or militia purposes. Disinformation is a weaponized version of misinformation.
